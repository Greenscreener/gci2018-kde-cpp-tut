# GCI2018 KDE C++ Tutorial
A repository for KDE's C++ tutorial from Google Code-In 2018


## Hello!
Hello dear mentor(s). I hope you have a lovely day! 

I have some time before CLion downloads so here is a short paragraph about my (inexistent) experience with C++ and Qt. 

I have never written C++ (I write Arduino Language, but I kinda feel like that doesn't count.) and I have zero programming experience with Qt. I use KDE Plasma on my OpenSUSE Tumbleweed machine, so I have at least user experince ;). 
I do web development as a hobby and I'm really happy with PHPStorm/WebStorm, so I decided to use CLion.

Oh! The download has finished, let's get to work!
